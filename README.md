# Hi, I'm Benjamin Foster! üëã


## üöÄ About Me
As you already know, my name is Ben! I was born and rasied in Eau Claire, WI but I currently live in New York with my beautiful wife Jill and our dog Winston! From a very early age, I was a highly curious person and I always wanted to learn more about the things that fascinated me! When I was accepted to the United States Military Academy at West Point, I planned to study engineering, however my curiosity got the best of me and I dove head first into Organizational Psychology and Leadership! I loved my education and it served me well, but as my time in the Army came to an early end, I had to find something else to do. That's when I remembered just how much I loved the world of technology, more specifically information security!

I now work full-time as an IT Associate with a family office in New York City thanks to some amazing connections! I love what I do and plan to make a career out of IT! As a current Cybersecurity Student, I love learning about how we can better protect ourselves online. I've also found a deep passion for learning how to code in many different languages, particularly Python and frontend languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! I hope to one day combine both of these passions to produce software that is both secure and helps keep us secure online! I hope that as time goes on, my GitHub profile will show just how much I love this work!


## üõ† Skills
Through the help of my college courses and online programs like Scrimba, I am currently growing my skills in the following programming languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python
- C (but just a little...)


## A little bit more about me.
üë©‚Äçüíª I'm currently working on a many projects that you will find repositories to on my account. Two that I'm especially excited about are a password generator project that I started on Scrimba and will continue working on for a while! You'll also see a repository for a calculator project that I am using to refine my JavaScript skills!

üß† I'm currently learning as much as I possibly can about frontend development. After I get done growing that wealth of knowledge, I would like to dedicate my time to learning backend development and eventually AI engineering. That is definitely the direction that a lot of software is going these days, and it would be foolish not to learn about it. Especially as I'm sure AI will serve its fair share of challenges as the technology grows.

ü§î I'm looking for to sharing many projects with the GitHub community and I hope that the work I do on here helps propel me forward into my dreams of being a software developer in the cybersecurity space.

‚ö°Ô∏è Fun fact: I'm a big fan of fly fishing! In my experience, this is a perfect complement to my current line of work because it is my escape and a way to get away from the many complicated aspects of work. I've fished all over the country but my eyes will always be set on the rivers of the Mountain West! It doesn't get better than that!

üì´ How to reach me: I feel comfortable receiving emails at benjaminafoster4@gmail.com. I am able to read and action emails at that address quickly, and I can just as quickly add spam traffic to my spam filter. It's a skill I've developed extensively. So no spamming.
